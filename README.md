# Udacity_DataAnalyst
 This is a project work I did for the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**
 

 ## Project 2 - No Show Appointments

This project is based on the dataset which collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row

## Project 3-Analyze AB test results

## Project 5-Wrangle and Analyze Data
The purpose of this project is to put in practice what I learned in data wrangling data section from Udacity Data Analysis
Nanodegree program. The dataset that is wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as
WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These
ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.
